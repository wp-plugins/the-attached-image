The Attached Image is a simple plugin that packs quite a punch. It shows the first image attached to the current post. It was inspired by a plugin wrote by Kaf Oseo, but when support was stopped &amp; a recent upgrade of WordPress meant it didn't work exactly like it used to I decided to take on the challenge of remaking it using the new WordPress functions available.

== Description ==

**Very Important:** The way The Attached Image works has changed due to the introduction of an options page. It makes the plugin easier to use but when you update to version 2.2 you will need to update the options (under the apprearence menu) to match what you were using. You will also need to find the function call in your template and empty any parameters out from it. So if you have `<?php the_attached_image('img_size=medium&href=true&link=post); ?>` you will need to change it to `<?php the_attached_image(); ?>` and set up the options to so that it does what you intend. Thank you and sorry about the awkwardness.
