V 1.6:
Added ability to show the full size image if wanted.
Suggested by Brian Wood.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.5:
Added the ability to choose an image that is not attached
to the current post defined in the post loop. Can be
selected in the template call or in the custom post meta.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.4.2:
Fixed another flaw in the width & height decision system.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.4.1:
Fixed flaw in width & height checking for custom
fields.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.4:
Added the ability to use a custom width & height.
Just like the default pic it can be defined in the
template function call or on a post by post basis
in the custom fields.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.3:
Added ability to choose a default image to show
should there be no image to display. If no default 
image is defined then nothing will be returned.
Default image can be defined in the post via
custom fields using 'default_pic' as the key.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.2 ~ 75 - 90:
Added the ability to output a link around the image.
You can choose to link to the pic (default), the
attachment page or the post that the image is attached to.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

V 1.1 ~ line 62 & 68:
Fixed a stupid mistake. Used strict type check for true.
Not going to work if the true is provided by argument
as it will be a string not a bool.
